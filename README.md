# Forum

## Introduction

<p align="justify">A web application prioritizing security, designed to facilitate basic forum functionalities. It features four main discussion topics: Science, Music, Sports, and Culture. Within each topic, users have the ability to post comments, subject to approval by moderators or administrators.

The system distinguishes between three types of user accounts: User, Moderator, and Admin. Regular users possess the ability to engage in discussions by commenting under various topics and view comments submitted by others. Moderators share the same privileges as regular users but also possess additional capabilities, including topic management within their designated permissions. Administrators possess the highest level of authority, granting them complete control over all functionalities within the system.

Admins possess the authority to manage user accounts, including setting permissions, approving or blocking accounts, and adjusting account types. They hold the power to configure permissions, approve or reject submitted content, enforce user bans, and modify account roles. </p>
